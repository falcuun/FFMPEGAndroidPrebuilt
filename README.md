# Prebuilt FFMPEG libraries for Android

  After going through hell and back in order to build the FFMPEG libraries for Android
  I have decided to host them on my github so that no one has to deal with what I had to.
  
  Libraries are built in .so format, along with header includes. 
  
  Platforms these libraries are built for are: 
    - arm64-v8a
    - armeabi-v74
    - x86
    - x86_64
   
## Usage:
  To use these libs, just download this repo as a zip
  Paste the content of these folders in your own library folder
  Link these through CMakeLists.txt
  Enjoy.
